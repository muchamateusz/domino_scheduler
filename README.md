# domino_scheduler
The idea is to create a little useful, intuitive and visually pretty app which will help people to arrange their time during the day. 

For now the main goal is to create it in React, using localStorage, drag'n drop component and mobile-first metodology.

It should consist of the main time axis, which should be splittable into pieces, under that axis should be a place to create boxes / tiles / domino cubes (draggable) where the user could type "what should be done at this hour of his day".
